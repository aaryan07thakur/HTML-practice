Octal refers to the base-8 numbering system. It comes from the Latin word for eight. The octal numbering system uses the numerals 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7. In computing environments, it is commonly used as a shorter representation of binary numbers by grouping binary digits into threes.The octal numeral system, or oct for short, is the base -8 number system, and uses the digits 0 to 7. </font>
